		<h1>Arduino Assignments</h1>
		<p>
		For this topic, Arduino, I carried out tasks with the help of the Arduino Kit. This is a kit that consists of a breadbord, jumper wires, a few sensors, and that kind of stuff. The arduino kit is a good tool to experiment with. In combination with code, you are able to build all sorts of different things. Most of the assignments are accompanied by pictures, code and a video in which is illustrated what to do, or what the result of the comibination of code and usage of the arduino kit should be. Every assignment is also accompanied by an explanation of the assignment. </p>
